- Topics
- Division Of work
  - Cyclic graph
  - Resnet architecture
  - One Cycle Policy
- Next meeting: Wednesday/Thursday 8 AM
  - Review
  - Challenges, communicate immediately

#### Notes 

##### Video

-  We use regularization to not stuck in minima
-  If using one cycle policy, we may not require other regularization techniques such as Image augmentation, dropout L1/L2 and weight decay etc.
-  Absolute Vs Relative threshold
-  SGD looks at the depth and not the direction
-  It looks at the steepest minima
-  Best LR is for the weights at that point of time
-  LR will vary based on weights
-  One Cycle Policy(OCP) is designed to reach higher accuracy in less no of epochs.
-  Momentum is pushing in the direction where training is moving.
-  We are moving away from GAP and using MP equal to size of image of 4.
